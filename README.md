BunnyBus is a high level enterprise bus implementation making pub/sub and queue management easy. 

Currently supports the following queueing frameworks.

- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)

## Introduction
BunnyBus abstracts away low level queue driver details such as creating a connection, creating a channel, creating bindings, creating subscribing queues and etc.  BunnyBus provides safe defaults for many setups which can also be configured.  The core of BunnyBus implements native node callbacks providing maximum performance.  BunnyBus provides two flavors of API for callbacks and Promise alike.  The BunnyBus CLI can be found [here](https://github.com/xogroup/bunnybus-cli) implementing this core driver.
